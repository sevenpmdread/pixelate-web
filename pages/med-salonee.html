      <div class="case-study--body--text">
        <p>Last year, this time, I was a final year Computer Science Engineering student frantically filling out my
          graduate applications; nervous because I was close to the finish line. On receiving my offers of admission a
          few
          months later, I was forced to defer my decision owing to the pandemic.</p>
        <p>
          I eventually accepted my offer of admission to Carnegie Mellon’s MHCI Program on the 16th of December, 2020.
        </p>
        <p>The application process is overwhelming and stressful, especially when you don’t know a lot of people
          applying
          to the same program as you. But, it is also very rewarding. It forces a level of introspection and self
          awareness that really makes you feel like you’ve come out of this entire process on better terms with
          yourself, irrespective of where you get in.</p>
        <p>My journey led me to offers from the following 7 programs: Carnegie Mellon (MHCI), University of California,
          Berkeley (MIMS), University of Washington (MHCI+D, HCDE), University of Maryland (HCIM), Indiana University,
          Bloomington (HCI/d), University of Texas (MSIS)</p>

        <p></p>
        Through this article, I hope to provide greater clarity into the graduate application process.
        <h3>What this article doesn’t do</h3>

        </ol>

        </ol>


        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>Right off the bat, I got to doing what I love doing the most: organising. I used Notion to keep a track of
          all
          the programs that I took a liking to. For each program, I listed the program name along with its attributes
          (program length, strength, tuition, deadlines, cohort size, application requirements, notable faculty, etc).
          Websites like Top UX School were very helpful for the initial phase of my research.</p>
        <p>After gathering enough information for an initial perception, I had a list of about 20 schools with a program
          that was relevant to me. I was eventually able to sieve through and narrow that list down to 8, after speaking
          to alumni and current students through LinkedIn, doing more in-depth research, and attending information
          sessions.</p>
        <h3>Quick Tips:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Don’t make decisions on the basis of the ranking of universities. No ranking of universities is linear,
            and your
            metrics don’t have to be the same as the metrics prioritised by the ranker. Do your research, what
            university
            fits you best?</li>
          <li>About ‘safe schools’: Are you willing to do a masters irrespective of where you get in? ‘Yes’ is a
            completely
            valid answer, but if your answer is ‘No’ then pick the schools that truly excite you, and apply there.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>Because I was also in college, I wasn’t able to give continuous time to my applications. During the semester
          (July - November), I focused on getting the Letters of Recommendation from the professors at my University. I
          also wrapped up my Portfolio and Resume, so that I could focus on my essays after I wrapped up my semester
          exams.</p>
        <p>Throughout the application process I ensured I diligently met all my targets on time. This would help me keep
          a
          buffer before the deadlines, to tie up any loose ends.</p>

        <h3>The GRE</h3>
        <p>I’m a nervous test taker, so the first thing I wanted to get off my list was the GRE. I also knew I wouldn’t
          have time during the semester to study for the exam. Therefore, I studied through the summer break (May -
          June)
          and gave my exam in the first week of July. I didn’t do anything else that summer. I focused all my energy on
          the exam, no side hustle.</p>
        <h3>
          Quick Tips:
        </h3>

        <ol>
          <li>The GRE is a part of your application, not your entire application. Don’t give yourself a terribly hard
            time. Go
            over university guidelines and do your research on the accepted applicants to understand what type of a
            score
            you need.</li>
          <li>Before beginning your prep, utilise free online diagnostic tests to understand where you stand.</li>
          <li>To get better at the Reading Comprehension section, subscribe to newspapers like The Atlantic, The New
            York
            Times, etc and read a few articles everyday.</li>
          <li>Download GRE vocabulary cards on your phone, so that they are accessible to you whenever you’re in the
            mood to
            practise words.</li>
          <li> Make a conscious effort to use GRE words in your regular vocabulary, even if it annoys your family and
            friends.
          </li>
          <li>We have different reading speeds on paper and on a screen, so practise on the medium that you’ll be giving
            your
            exam on.</li>
          <li>If you feel lazy practising writing essays, curate a list of GRE essay prompts off of the internet, and
            discuss
            one prompt with a family or friend everyday.</li>
          <li>Book your exam date as soon as possible, it will restrain you from straying.</li>
        </ol>




        <h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
        <p>Still an undergraduate, I did not have any work experience. Among others, I reached out to my mentors and
          teammates in the startups I’d worked for, and interned under. I focused on finding people that know me well,
          irrespective of their title. The recommendation process spans beyond a letter. It requires the recommender to
          answer questions about you, for multiple universities. So, it was important to approach people you are
          comfortable communicating with</p>

      <div class="case-study--body--text">
        <h3>Quick Tips:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Approach mentors, supervisors and professors that that know you personally. They will have something
            unique and
            personal to add to your story.</li>
          <li>Choose recommenders based on the type of programme you’re applying to - an academic program will prefer
            professors and professional program would prefer recommenders from the industry.</li>
          <li>If possible, approach recommenders that can attest to the projects/ research you’ve talked about in your
            Statement of Purpose. It helps build legitimacy and trust, and gives the committee a more holistic idea of
            you.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
        <p>I enjoy writing, so I had fun with this part of the my application. I didn’t get a counsellor to help me with
          this process, because I did not want my voice to be diluted. Instead, I kept a close group of mentors that
          gave
          me feedback on my drafts. I ensured that the the mentors I chose were not afraid to be critical and honest
          while
          reviewing my SOP, and were also from diverse (and non-HCI) backgrounds. While I took everyone’s feedback, I
          put
          to paper what felt right to me.</p>

        <h3>Quick Tips:</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Universities are looking for applicants that truly fit into their program. <b>Portraying yourself as
              someone
              you’re not in you application, will only impede you from going somewhere you would’ve fit better and
              hence,
              grown better.</b></li>
          <li>Remember that your application will be judged holistically, you don’t have to try and fit in everything
            in
            your SOP. If there is something you’re proud of doing, that doesn’t directly contribute to your SOP,
            that’s
            fine. It’s still in your resume.</li>
          <li>Your SOP is a story, and like every story, it needs a plot. You don’t need to portray yourself as a
            perfect,
            all knowing human. If that were the case, you wouldn’t be applying in the first place.</li>
          <li> Elaborate on the takeaways from your experiences, to explain how they shaped you. Eg. Instead of saying
            “I
            attended an HCI Conference in 2019, which broadened my horizons”, say “I studied the challenges faced by
            the
            elderly while using E-Wallets during an HCI conference I attended in 2019. Being able to use principles of
            inclusive design to alleviate their discomfort inspired me delve deeper into creating more inclusive
            experiences.”</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Resume</h3>
        <p>This was one of the less time consuming parts of my application. I tried to restrict the description of each
          of
          my milestones to 1–2 crisp lines.</p>
        <h3>Quick Tips:</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mention that your CGPA is out of 4 or 10, so there’s no confusion. Eg, 9.2/10</li>
          <li>Don’t overthink the layout, and refrain from using complicated templates.</li>
          <li>While describing your milestones, use numbers to convey the extent of your contribution. Eg. ‘6 National
            Parliamentary Debating awards’</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>I didn’t have a portfolio before I began the application process. I chose to make an online portfolio because
          it
          was easier to manage, and share. I eventually also needed the PDF version for some universities (Indiana
          University).</p>
        <p> I created my portfolio using Adobe Portfolio. I was short on time, and Adobe offered simple templates that
          are fairly easy to set up. (Now that I’ve more time, I’m working on making one on Squarespace instead)</p>

        <h3>Quick Tips:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Don’t overcrowd, showcase a couple of projects that explain your range and palette.</li>
          <li>Take time to explain your design process, and your unique contribution(s) in each project.</li>
          <li>In the end of each project page, talk about your insights from from the project.</li>
          <li>You can use google analytics, to track activity on your online portfolio to gauge when and for how long,
            an
            evaluator from a University was viewing your portfolio. On an average, they spend a minute on each of your
            project pages.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Video Essay</h3>
        <p>Carnegie Mellon was the only HCI program that required a video essay, but I know it’s a requirement in many
          other graduate programs as well. This task was very open- ended and gave you the freedom interpret it your
          way.
          In case you feel stuck, go through the previous years’ submissions for your program. I’d recommend only using
          those videos as inspiration, and creating something that’s unique to your style and personality.</p>
        <p>Since Carnegie did not ask for a Personal Statement, I wanted my video essay to focus on my personal and
          non-academic motivations behind a masters. (Here’s a link to my video)</p>

        <h3>Waiting</h3>
        <p>
          I felt a wave of relief when I submitted my last application. After that, I caught up on sleep, saw my friends
          and tried my best to focus on what’s in front of me.
          As I got closer to hearing from the universities, Gmail became my best friend. I followed updates on The
          GradeCafe and and r/gradadmissions (don’t get too attached, it can sometimes be harmful and
          discouraging).Through these platforms, I was added to groups on Telegram. Interacting with people in the same
          boat as me, helped alleviate some of the anxiety.
        </p>
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          Both Carnegie Mellon and UC Berkeley also had a round of interviews, a few weeks after I submitted my
          application. To prepare, I reached out to current students in both the programs to understand what questions
          are often asked and practised my responses. I’d recommend not trying to script your responses.
        </p>
        <h3>Making your decision</h3>
        <p>
          At this point, you will have a lot of people telling you what they think you should do. Hear them all out.
          Talk to the alumni, the program advisors and the current cohort; do your research. Listen and absorb what
          everyone says, and then make your decision.
